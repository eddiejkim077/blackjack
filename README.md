# BLACKJACK
-

### Basics
A player's main objective is to beat the dealer with the cards given. A player must also not "bust" or go over the allowed amount of 21. If a player does not bust with the given hand they have the opportunity to outscore the dealer. A dealer must also not go over 21. 21 is **BLACKJACK**.

### Card value
An Ace counts as 1 or 11.

10, Jack, Queen, King counts as 10.

2-9 counts as face value. 


###How to play
1. All players will have to place a bet.
2. The dealer will give two cards to each person at the table and two cards to themselves. With 1 card faced down, and 1 card faced up.
3. If the dealer is showing an Ace they will ask for insurance. 
4. If the dealer is showing a 10 or Ace they will check to see if they have blackjack, and if they do they will reveal their cards immediately.
5. If the dealer has blackjack, all bets are taken unless another player has blackjack then it would be a "push".
6. If the dealer does not have blackjack play begins.
7. A player has the option to stand, hit, double down, split. 
8. Stand: A player does not receive anymore cards, and ends turn.
9. Hit: Player receives one more card or more if they choose, but ends turn if they go over 21.
10. Double: A player doubles his bet, and only gets one card to end turn. 
11. Split: If the player has a pair they have the option to split their cards into two hands. All the rules above apply to splitted pairs.
12. After all players have ended their turn, the dealer will uncover their second card. 
13. If the dealer has 16 or less they will have to draw another card until they reach 17 or over. 
14. If the dealer goes over 21, all the players remaining for that deal will win their bet back. 
15. If the dealer does not bust, then any player that has a higher value in cards will win.
